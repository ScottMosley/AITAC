I hope this message finds you well. We are reaching out to invite your feedback on what we are currently calling the Christian AI Manifesto: Upholding Human Dignity in the Age of Artificial Intelligence. This document is designed to challenge business and ministry leaders to think more comprehensively about how and when to use AI in ways that align with our faith and values.
Our ultimate intent is to refine this manifesto with the input of trusted leaders like yourself, culminating in a final version endorsed by a few influential Christian voices. We hope it will serve as a meaningful conversation guide for the Church and others as they navigate the opportunities and challenges AI presents.

To that end, we are seeking as much objective feedback as possible to ensure this document is thoughtful, biblically sound, and practically relevant. Your insights would be invaluable in helping us shape a manifesto that faithfully represents our collective responsibility in this space.

Would you be open to reviewing the current draft and sharing your thoughts? We would be grateful for any feedback you can offer.

Thank you for considering this, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
