# Christian AI Manifesto
Upholding Human Dignity in the Age of Artificial Intelligence
 
We, as followers of Christ, acknowledge the responsibility entrusted to us in using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a way that honors God and upholds the dignity of all human beings. Rooted in Scripture, this manifesto guides us to use AI in accordance with the principles of our faith, ensuring that technology serves humanity without compromising our God-given purpose or values.
 
## 1. Dignity and Imago Dei (Image of God)
* Intrinsic Human Value and Creativity: We affirm that humans are made in God's image, possessing a unique dignity and creativity that AI cannot replicate (Genesis 1:26-27). Our creativity is a reflection of God’s nature, a deeply spiritual activity that invites meaningful engagement with the world.
* _Protecting Human Creativity:_ We commit to fostering human creativity, resisting the temptation to rely on AI for tasks that diminish our engagement with the creative gifts God has given us (Exodus 28:3; 31:3).
 
## 2. Purpose and Meaning
Affirming Our Purpose as God's Workmanship: We recognize that AI should be used to support individuals in discovering their God-given purpose, enabling the fulfillment of the good works He prepared for us (Ephesians 2:10).
Supporting Spiritual Well-Being: We believe AI should encourage spiritual growth, facilitating practices such as prayer, Bible study, and service that deepen our relationship with God and align us with His divine plan.
 
## 3. Ethical Boundaries and Moral Guidance
Responsible Use of AI: In accordance with biblical stewardship, we commit to using AI in ways that promote truth, privacy, and compassion, avoiding any actions that dehumanize others (Genesis 2:15).
Avoiding the Temptation of Power and Control: We caution against the dangers of unchecked power, as exemplified in the story of the Tower of Babel, and strive to prevent the manipulation or over-dependence on AI for control over individuals (Genesis 11:1-9).
 
## 4. Stewardship of Creation
Stewarding Resources Responsibly: We are called to responsibly steward the resources God has given us, including AI, using it to enhance work and serve society while glorifying God in all we do (Genesis 1:28; 1 Corinthians 10:31).
Purposeful Use of AI: We seek wisdom in our use of AI, prioritizing responsible stewardship and the common good over profit (Proverbs 3:5-6).
AI for the Common Good: AI should serve global needs, addressing issues like poverty, healthcare, and education, fostering justice and equality, rather than perpetuating exploitation. 
 
## 5. Community and Relationality
Fostering Relationships Over Isolation: AI must be used to strengthen bonds between individuals and communities, rather than isolating or reducing interactions to shallow exchanges (1 Corinthians 12:27).
Encouraging Compassion and Love: We commit to using AI to promote empathy, love, and care for others, in alignment with Jesus’ command to love one another (John 13:34).
 
## 6. Responsibility and Discernment
Truth, Trust, and Integrity: We must be truthful and transparent in our use of AI, ensuring that AI-generated content is clearly identified and that we do not mislead others by presenting machine work as our own (Exodus 20:16; Matthew 22:37-39).
Accountability for Developers and Users: We take responsibility for our actions, carefully evaluating the impact of our AI systems to ensure they align with Christian principles and moral responsibility (1 Thessalonians 5:21-22).
Practicing Discernment: We approach AI with caution, exercising discernment to ensure it aligns with Christian values, guided by prayer and biblical counsel (Philippians 1:9-10).
 
## 7. Guarding Against Deception
Awareness of Spiritual Deception: We recognize the potential for AI to generate false narratives, and we commit to remaining vigilant and discerning, grounded in the truth of God’s Word (Revelation 13:14).
Combatting Falsehoods with Truth: We commit to using AI to uphold truth, exposing and countering falsehoods, and ensuring transparency in all AI outputs (John 8:32).
Anchoring in God's Truth: We affirm that God’s Word is the ultimate authority, and all uses of AI must be tested against His eternal truth (John 14:6).
 
In all things, we commit to using AI as a tool that reflects the image of God in us, to promote His truth, justice, and love, and to serve humanity in a way that honors the dignity and purpose He has bestowed upon us. May AI be used not as a replacement for human creativity, relationships, or purpose, but as an instrument to fulfill God's will and bring glory to His name.
